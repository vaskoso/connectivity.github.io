        <p> There is connection to others at all capacities but each level remains important. And how insane is that? The complicated emotions and feelings involved in these interpersonal relationships. Friends, partners, peers everyone you know exists in your mind and you have certain feelings towards them wether you’re aware of them or not. </p>
        <p> These emotional connections we share with one another can be such an overpowering source. Feeling these emotions and more importantly being aware of them is such an essential part of life. It’s love, it’s appreciation and more often than not it’s these relationships that define meaning </p>
