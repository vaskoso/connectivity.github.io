    <h2>it's all about the connections you make </h2>
    <p>
        I mean this at every conceivable perception of this sentence. 
        From the connection you make through thought, in the physical 
        realm, in interpersonal relationships, while building something, 
        the list could continue. Really I mean this at every capacity of 
        being alive. From the lessons you learn to the intrinsic understanding 
        each individual has of their own reality, all the way to this inherent 
        connection you feel to the earth or your fellow man. How we can bridge 
        those individual realities together, form that connection, create 
        something more than itself, the utter essence of what makes us all 
        so [[human]]. It's all about the connections you make. 
<p>
Throughout life, in [[feeling]] and [[talking]], 
[[communicating (in any form)]] we see these connection 
grow and change, it's a very human thing but beyond that 
[[connection is apart of all things. ]]</p>

Its through connection where the best ideas form
