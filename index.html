        There's a profound feeling to the world, I can only describe as connection. I find that this essence of interconnectivity between all things to be an incredibly powerful thing. There was a point where I realized just how important this connection was, a life changing experience of sorts created by an accumulation of circumstances which has led me to wanting to create this website. Although a website about connectivity sounded appealing, such a <a id=vauge href="#">vauge</a> topic could only lead me to find out how little I know about connectivity and how difficult it was to explain.

          Ted Nelson describes his original vision of what the internet could have been, creating a tool that unifies us, helping us truly understand the sources of information we draw upon. The idea of the internet’s structure inherently incorporating this philosophy into the core of its functionality had such emotional appeal. Nelson describes his understanding of the world and his desire for others to share this understanding with others. At its core this philosophy he describes is the ability to connect.

<div class="text-2 draggable png_drag main-nav" style="width: 400px;">
      <p>“Once the human lineage had achieved a 
        sufficiently large brain and had developed 
        a sufficiently sophisticated culture (sometime 
        around 40,000–50,000 years ago according to 
        Gould, but more commonly placed at 10,000 years ago with the development of agriculture), cultural evolution supplanted biological evolution."

<p class ="text-6">Our minds are essentially the same as people living in Mesopotamia and yet we find ourselves in such a technologically advanced complicated society. We can pity ourselves for not having the “simple lives” of farmers or hunter gathers, assuming life would have been much more freeing and easier back then but you have to imagine that what we have today was an inevitability of human curiosity. Hunting mammoths got old, intellectual challenges became far more satiating. Throughout all of time, there have always been dreamers and groups of people inspired to push the agenda. The remnants of history have shown us just how 
  <a id= htemple href="#" >brilliant people were.</a></p>
