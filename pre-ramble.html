    <h2>before you read...</h2>
      <p >For a little preamble before you <a id = badjoke1 href="#">dive any deeper</a>, I want to just defend myself a little here and say this writing is just
        some form of messy monologuing. I'm young, and I'm no Ted Nelson, maybe in another 60 years I'll have had the time to figure out exactly how to explain this concept 
        in the most well articulated and poetic way possible.
        Eventually, I'll be able to elaborate on why I feel like this level of connection is 
        so essential/imporant, but just keep in mind, I am no writer... </p>
