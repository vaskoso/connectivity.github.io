    <h2>Cogito, ergo sum</h2>
    
        <p> I think therefor I am. That's all I do is think and ponder and think again, hopefully in the opposite approach to the previous thought. Thinking is just so interesting, it is the basis of forming your reality and the subconscious silent action behind every action and reaction. To think, to think all the time to overthink, something I've been accused of many times (rightfully so). To become lost in one's own mind, the labyrinth of thought, a labyrinth built upon a excess access to information, experience and resources. 
        </p>
        <p>Connection of thought is the key to all of this to begin with. All I wanted for this project was an accumulation of knowledge to explain something about the reality we find ourselves in. A collection of information is useful to some extent but it's the creative ability to connect and choose this information to formulate new ideas. This can be done at every capacity of thought, coming to revelations academically, personally or otherwise.</p>
        <p>"I think therefor I am." A confirmation of reality put into such simple words but it's embued with incredbly deep torment (or meaning). I believe philosophy is one huge loop, there is no singular/right answer there is no solution it's only a matter of discussion. </p>
