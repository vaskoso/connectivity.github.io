    <h2>this topic</h2>
    <p>
      When I'm trying to write about this topic I find it's incredibly conceptual and heavily based on my own opinions.
      I think this could present a problem as it exists as less as a resource and more as a personal journal which is why I
       must collect as much as possible from across the web to prove the value of having another website
       linking a bunch of other websites. Oh god, this isn't valuable at all but it's something I guess I'm passionate about so
      it's as relevant as any other subject. Why is this something I'm passionate about?
