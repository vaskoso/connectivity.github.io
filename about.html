    <h2>about??</h2>
    <p>
        What was this all about? Great question. I think there are wild possiblities for change if we could collectivly work together to achive the things we've already achived, to see what works, what doesn't and commit to creating something we all deeply desire. A world filled with connection.

    <p> I've noticed one thing missing from the general narritives of society, peharps its the our one salvaiton from machines. A human trait which destinctly defines us as human. The capacity to feel emotion, to genuninly care, it's the one thing that gives us humanity. This emotional quotent, is taken for granted most of the time or misinterpreted in ways that don’t capture the whole picture of the hidden world of complicated emotions. Labled into categories that don’t fully encapsulate the incredbly complex emotions we all have. The word sad or happy can and will mean something different for everyone. Philosophy, the way to contectualize and overexplain complex emotions. But imbuing philosophy in this emotional context to the systems we have at large would be an amazing thing for the world. It would make these inevitable systems more human, and that’s something I think we desperately need. <p>

      <p>I would like to see more industries take a step back and understand what industry is, what it was built upon/with. It's all people, we're all people, who love and care and experince life at all capacities. There is this avid mistake of turning socital systems into their own identity.  With a coperate name a small business ran by your fellow neighbour turns into an industry bigger than itself, forgetting it’s roots and that unifying interpersonal factor at play. To villinize or admire, these coporations become larger than life, and I personally don’t think that’s a good thing. It’s all just people and the rules/systems they’ve invented for themselves, grouped together in their collective name.
      </p>
      
      <p> All the greatest works of art, all the best ventures in soceity were only made possible when intelect and emotion worked together in a harmonious, interconnected relationship. </p>
