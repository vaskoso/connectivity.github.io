    <h2>Isolated</h2>
    <p> In context to space I think it’s this isolation is unifying, or suffocating. Depends on your perspective I suppose. We’re the only lifeforms out there as far as we know or as far as the goverment lets us know (I’ve been watching a lot of the x-files-great show). </p>

    <p> Isolation is funny. I think it leads to a lot of growth and personal exploration of both your mind, values, soul, basically any aspect of yourself will be examined and critisized in pure isolation; it can drive a man mad. I’ve heard about using isolation as a form of punishment in the prison system. We’re social animals I suppose but I wonder if it’s beneficial for people to experience pure isolation for a period of time, as I’ve noticed how much social interaction influences behaviour. </p>
