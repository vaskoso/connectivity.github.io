    <h2>Nuance</h2>
    
    <p> History is an excellent thing to learn but more often than not history is written and taught by the victors. A skewed perception of the past, highlighting the importance of certain individuals/cultures while not telling the whole story. Only now are we begging to rewrite and understand these things differently, treating history with the nuance it deserves.
