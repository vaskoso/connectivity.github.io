        <p> It almost seems like an easy recipe, but to have all these things align and the ability to move forward is far more difficult than you would imagine, I guess thatâ€™s the downside to all this wishful thinking, the pessimistic intrusive thought that none of this will get done, sheer willpower just leads to burn out (at least for me) I don't have enough energy to keep up with pretty much anything I aspire to achieve. How can I put that expectation on others? </p>
        <p>Finding the right people may be the key to all of this but it's the active effort of effective communication (and a bunch of other stuff) which leads to genuine productive relationships.</p>
