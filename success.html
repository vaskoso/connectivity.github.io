        <p> It was never competition or hostility which led to the success of , often that was the biggest downfall of our species and led to the greatest destruction. It’s caring for one another or for people as a whole that created all the things we love about the world. Aggressive competition against one another produces corrupt systems and ways of thinking which lead to poor results. 

            *I think internal competition is something different but that’s a topic for another  time. * </p>
            
        <p> I find it so fascinating that we have such a high capacity to care. We want to create systems (we have created systems) of accessibility to help each other out. We have an innate desire to save one another. I think this part of ourselves is ingrained in us, it’s reflected in our culture and is generally the root cause of all our disappointment in the world. We want to save one another, end global hunger, solve homelessness, create systems of equality. We can see the progression of history reflecting those ideals. It’s written into scripture across culture, the classic love thy neighbor, an example of this from the bible being "Let each of you look not only to his own interests but also to the interests of others" (Philippians 2:4). But this desire extends past religion, religion just solidified it by putting it into words and a book. </p>
