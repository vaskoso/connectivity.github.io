      <h2>connectivity reinstated</h2>
      <p>
          This is another attempt at explaining why connectivity is
          such an important thing to understand, it is the biggest
          recourse, all encompassing and never ending. Almost a grand
          over arching conspiracy of sorts. A complicated matter which
           could... </p>
  
  
  <p>Even in Obsidian's mission statement it says, very neatly,
      "Everything is Connected". In this context perhaps they're
      referring to process of all thoughts begin connected. While  
     Ted Nelson's vision of this inherent connectivity
      related to his vision of the internet hoping to show those vital
      visual connections between all things </p>
          <p>I guess this is my own interpretation (or one of, my interpretations) of connectivity.
