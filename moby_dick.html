    <h2>Moby Dick</h2>
<p>
        I've never read Moby Dick.
I've <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZS_6-IwMPjM" target="_blank">heard</a> plenty about it though, enough to 
understand it's culture significance (maybe). 
I'm simply using it as a topic to divulge into 
my own topic, so perhaps I've assigned my own 
significance to it, WHICH IS THE POINT I'M TRYING 
TO MAKE IN THE FIRST PLACE (spoilers). </p>

<p>Here are my personal facts about Moby Dick:</p>
<p> 1.It's a book about a guy hunting a whale</p>
<p>2. There may be hidden wisdom in this book if you read between the lines</p>
<p>3. [[It's a long ass book</p>
<p>4. It's only up to speculation if there was any meaning in the book at all</p>
<p>5. It was engrained in our culture- for some reason?/was it?</p>

<p> Number 4 is why were here today, 
as we attempt to relate this obscure metaphor to connectivity. 
See there must have been a point where a man picked up this 
book in 1851, dedicated hours to reading it and proceeded to declare 
it had profound metaphorical significance as study.com puts it 
"**The white whale is a metaphor for the destructive force of nature**" . 
This concept somehow stuck and now when researching (googling) 
the book there lies this metaphor section, as if it's important 
knowledge to have associated with the book. But Herman Melville might have just 
wanted to write a book about righteous vengeance against a whale, a good tale of a 
simple killing. Now his book is associated with concepts that he never created, 
similar to how I project onto Ted Nelson's visions of the internet or any other comment 
that's simply related to connection or connectivity. Although I find this wildly amusing, 
to pick up little bits and pieces of the connections I've found, it's the significance 
I impose upon these concepts where all the meaning lies. The point being, it's all about the connections you make.
